In this project, we will predict the age of abalones based on physical measurements.  The age of an abalone is determined by cutting the shell into a cone, staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope - a boring and time-consuming task.  We will try to find a correlation between the age of an abalone and its physical characteristics. Based on this dependence, a machine learning model will be derived to predict the age of the abalone.
